# Kafka



![](../images/kafka-apis.png)

There are 4 core APIs in Kafka system.

* **Producer API**: allows an application to publish a stream of records to one or more Kafka topics. 
* **Consumer API**: allows an application to subscribe to one or more topics and process the stream of records produced to them. 
* **Streams API**: allows an application to act as aÂ *stream processor*, consuming an input stream from one or more topics and producing an output stream to one or more output topics, effectively transforming the input streams to output streams. 
* **Connector API**: allows building and running reusable producers or consumers that connect Kafka topics to existing applications or data systems. For example, a connector to a relational database might capture every change to a table.
